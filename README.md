MayaASCIIImporter
=================
This Blender (http://www.blender.org) AddOn enables you to import Maya ASCII (.ma) files that contain tracking data exported from Autodesk MatchMover into Blender.

A few things to be aware of:

-The script was only tested with Maya ASCII files exported from Autodesk MatchMover (although files from other applications should work as well)
-At the moment animated markers aren't supported

Also:

A Maya ASCII export script for Blender is in development.
