MayaASCIIImporter
=================
This Blender (http://www.blender.org) AddOn enables you to import Maya ASCII (.ma) files that contain tracking data exported from Autodesk MatchMover into Blender.
(Should also work for .ma files generated by other applications, but it was only tested with files generated by Autodesk MatchMover.)
